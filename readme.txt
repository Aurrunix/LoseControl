LoseControl makes it easy to see the duration of crowd control spells on your character by prioritizing all your debuffs and displaying the icon for the one with the longest remaining duration in the middle of your screen. It's also compatible with any CooldownCount or OmniCC type mods that display a timer on top of the icon.
